## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* install ipynb
* opencv2 for python
* sci-kit learn

### Installing

* File names have been kept from downloaded Barnacle folder
* img1.png and img2.png have been cropped to the main region because I wasn't able to automate the cropping process using opencv
* Testing and training image datasets can be found in directories 'testing' and 'training' respectively, each with subdirectories separating images of barnacle objects and nonbarnacle objects

### Executing program

* Load in classification_functions.ipynb to access the functions used for classification
* Run cells in barnacle_classification.ipynb in sequential order
